# Road Accident Data Analysis Dashboard

## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze road accident data to identify patterns and insights that can help in understanding the causes and consequences of road accidents. The ultimate goal is to use this analysis to propose measures to reduce the occurrence of road accidents and improve road safety.

## Steps Followed

1. **Download Data from Kaggle:**
   - Access the Kaggle website and search for relevant road accident datasets.
   - Download the selected dataset(s) to your local machine.

2. **Transform Data using Excel or Power BI:**
   - Load the dataset into Excel or Power BI.
   - Clean the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting any errors.
   - Transform the data as needed, including formatting columns, creating new calculated fields, and aggregating data.

3. **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
   - Use Excel or Power BI to create various visualizations such as charts, graphs, and dashboards.
   - Analyze the data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations related to road accidents.
   - Generate insights from the visualizations to understand the factors contributing to road accidents.

4. **Develop and Publish Dashboard:**
   - Design an interactive dashboard in Power BI (or another suitable tool) to present the findings.
   - Include key metrics, visualizations, and filters to allow users to explore the data.
   - Publish the dashboard on Power BI Service (if applicable) or export it for sharing.

## Insights from Data

1. **Time and Day Analysis:**
   - Peak accident times: Most accidents occur during rush hours (morning and evening).
   - Day of the week: Higher accident rates are observed on weekends.

2. **Weather Conditions:**
   - Adverse weather conditions (rain, fog, snow) significantly increase the likelihood of accidents.

3. **Location Analysis:**
   - Urban vs. rural: Higher accident rates in urban areas due to higher traffic density.
   - Accident hotspots: Specific intersections or stretches of road with a high frequency of accidents.

4. **Vehicle Involvement:**
   - Type of vehicles: Certain types of vehicles (e.g., motorcycles, trucks) are more frequently involved in accidents.
   - Multi-vehicle vs. single-vehicle: Analysis of accidents involving multiple vehicles compared to single-vehicle incidents.

5. **Human Factors:**
   - Driver behavior: High incidence of accidents due to speeding, distracted driving, and driving under the influence.
   - Age and gender: Analysis of accident rates across different age groups and genders.

6. **Severity and Consequences:**
   - Injury severity: Breakdown of accidents resulting in fatalities, serious injuries, and minor injuries.
   - Economic impact: Estimation of the economic cost of road accidents, including medical expenses, vehicle damage, and lost productivity.
